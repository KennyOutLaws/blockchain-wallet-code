# wallet-code
This repo contains all kinds of wallet code used in blockchain, BTC, BTC Cash, SLP, Eth...
# announcement
This project was finished during my intern in Honestnode. Some codes are subject to show because of the credential issues of the company. However, most valuable codes are pushed to this repo, hope it would help some developers get some intuition and experience in constructing their own wallet code.
# algorithms
The common encryption algorithm: Base32, Base58 converter; HmacSha512; RipeMD160; Sha256.
# common:
Some classes encapsulated which are aimed to achieve the generic programming goal.
# util:
ByteArrayUtils(common algorithm used in the procedure of deriving wallet address) WifKeyUtils
# wallet:
Essential code of constructing different type of wallets
